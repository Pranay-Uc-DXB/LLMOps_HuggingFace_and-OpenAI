Putting services into production is an important skill along with traditional ML, AI, & Data Science knowledge. Through this project, I want to leverage present data cloud services with evolving LLMs that will, in near future, become more cheaper, efficient, and sustainable for cloud hosting. Some of the popular use cases for LLMs in business have been listed below

1. Chatbots and virtual assistants
2. Content writing
3. Talent acquisition and recruiting
4. Coding
5. Translation
6. Automating ad-hoc data requests or querying for analysis
7. Targeted advertising
